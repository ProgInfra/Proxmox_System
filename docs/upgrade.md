## Description

If you have an **older version** of **Proxmox**, you probably want to **upgrade it**, the best way is to **reinstall** your server and your proxmox, but in some case you **can't do this** (for example if your server is in **production environment** or if your **VPS don't let you install** your own OS and the version is too old)

**BUT don't worry**, **Proxmox** have planned that, you have a **good documentation** to upgrade your **Proxmox**, you can find these informations in this [documentation](https://pve.proxmox.com/wiki/Category:Upgrade). (You can also see some **Youtube tutorial** to upgrade your **Proxmox**)

## Upgrade from 6.x to 7.0

On OneProvider, we have the latest version of **Proxmox 6**, but it's not the **latest version** of Proxmox, there are the **version 7 available**, so we want to upgrade it.
